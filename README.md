# FlooberEngine
A basic 2D game engine in Java, built using LWJGL 3. I use this engine for my personal projects.

Current features:
- 2D rendering capabilities (quads, textured quads, circles)
- Particle system with configurable particle behaviors, customizable emitters
- Configurable loaders to load assets on game startup
- Multichannel audio system for music and SFX
- Support for tile-based games (such as platformers) with simple local lighting
- Simple GUI library with customizable elements and built-in event system
- Support for GLSL shaders and post-processing effects
- Resizable game window (when not in fullscreen), auto-resizes viewport to preserve aspect ratio
